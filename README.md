# Js-Mini-Projects
Collection of small vanilla JS projects including a CRUD app, pagination, fetch, smooth scroll and so on...

These projects are completed by myself while following John Smilga's JS course on Udemy. HTML and CSS structures are taken from the course files while I've implemented the functionality separately for practise purposes. If you wonder original codes of these projects, please visit the course owner's repo below.
